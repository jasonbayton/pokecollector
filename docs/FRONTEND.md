## Auth Flow

### `AuthContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`.

Responsibilities:

- Fetches `/api/auth/mode` on startup
- In single-user mode, attempts `/api/auth/me` without a token
- In multi-user mode, restores user from stored token if present
- Exposes:
  - `user`
  - `loading`
  - `multiUser`
  - `loginUser(token, userData)`
  - `updateCurrentUser(updates)`
  - `logout()`

Security-related behavior:

- `logout()` removes token and user from local storage
- Logout forces a full page reload to clear cached React Query data and prevent cross-user leakage
- Axios also clears auth state on `401`

### Login and Password Change

- `pages/Login.jsx` is only used when `multiUser === true`
- `App.jsx` defines an inline `ForcePasswordChangeScreen`
- If `user.must_change_password` is true, normal app routes are blocked until `/api/auth/me/force-password` succeeds

## Settings & Localization

### `SettingsContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/SettingsContext.jsx`.

Provides:

- `settings`
- `updateSettings(updates)`
- `t(path)`
- `language`
- `priceDisplay`
- `pricePrimary`
- `pricePrimaryField`
- `currency`
- `currencySymbol`
- `exchangeRate`
- `formatPrice(eurAmount)`
- `formatUsdPrice(usdAmount)`

Notes:

- Translation bundles are loaded from `frontend/src/i18n/` and wired in `SettingsContext`
- UI languages include all supported TCGdex language codes, plus Swedish. Regional variants such as `es-mx`, `pt-br`, `pt-pt`, `zh-tw`, and `zh-cn` are selectable from a compact dropdown in Settings.
- Legacy stored `zh` settings are normalized in the frontend to `zh-cn` for display
- USD display uses exchange rates from the backend Frankfurter endpoint

### `useTheme`

Defined in `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.js`.

- Stores the selected theme in `localStorage`
- Applies theme via `data-theme` on `document.documentElement`
- Available themes:
  - `default`
  - `fire`
  - `water`
  - `grass`
  - `electric`
  - `psychic`
  - `dragon`
  - `dark`
  - `fairy`

## Navigation

### Home / Portal Navigation

- `pages/HomeScreen.jsx` is the main portal view
- The app now uses a compact navigation pattern with 6 primary portal items on the home screen
- Secondary sections are organized with grouped tabs on individual pages

### `TabNav`

Defined in `frontend/src/components/TabNav.jsx`.

- Reusable horizontal tab bar
- Marks a tab active if the current pathname equals or starts with the tab path
- Used by pages such as `Dashboard`, `Collection`, `Wishlist`, `Binders`, `Analytics`, `Products`, `Leaderboard`, and `Achievements`

### `Layout` and `AppNav`

- `components/Layout.jsx` wraps protected routes
- `components/AppNav.jsx` shows the current page title and multi-user logout control

### Quick add

`contexts/ScannerContext.jsx` owns the scanner, the manual-card form and the one
scan-queue query for the whole app. It is mounted inside `ProtectedRoutes`, so it
is inside the router it navigates with and absent from the login screen and the
public `/u` pages. Both panels are loaded on demand: nothing of the scanner is in
the chunk the entry point loads, and once opened it stays mounted so its
generation guard survives every later close.

`components/QuickAddButton.jsx` is the floating control `Layout` renders on every
page, mirroring the bottom-left pokeball. It offers four actions - scan, card
search, create a card manually, scan queue - carries the outstanding-review count
that used to sit on the home screen's search tile, and:

- opens the scanner and the manual-card form over the current page, and walks to
  `/search` or `/scans` only when the user is not already there
- creates a manual card **with** the add-to-collection step, because quick add is
  an add-to-collection control
- is not drawn on `/scans` or `/scans/:jobId`: the queue is a route rendered as a
  modal, so the control would sit under its backdrop, unusable, and a click on it
  would dismiss the queue
- closes on Escape from anywhere, on a click outside, and when focus leaves it,
  returning focus to the button it was opened with

## Key Screens

### `pages/Login.jsx`

- Multi-user login screen
- Supports quick return to the last signed-in user via `lastUser` and `lastUserAvatar` in local storage

### `pages/Leaderboard.jsx`

- Social ranking view for multi-user mode
- Uses `TabNav`

### `pages/Compare.jsx`

- Side-by-side trainer comparison
- Route parameter: `userId`

### `pages/Achievements.jsx`

- Shows achievements for current user or another user when `:userId` is present

### `pages/Settings.jsx`

- Mixes per-user preferences and admin-only controls
- Admin users can enable multi-user mode from Settings
- When multi-user mode is enabled, admin users see a **Users** tab
- The **Users** tab supports creating users, editing usernames/roles/passwords, activating/deactivating users, deleting other users, and forcing first-login password changes
- Includes:
  - profile name editing
  - avatar picker
  - theme picker
  - app language dropdown and currency controls
  - TCGdex sync-language selection for admins
  - Telegram and Gemini keys
  - per-user scanner diagnostics consent and explicit stored-data deletion
  - sync controls
  - auth mode toggle
  - backup and restore
  - Community sections for contributors and supporters

The supporter section calls the installation's own `/api/community/supporters` endpoint once whenever the Community view is entered. It retains the last valid result only in the browser's in-memory query cache, hides that cache while the entry fetch is pending or after it fails, and performs no timed, background, or focus-based refreshes. Above the supporter cards it shows the supporter count, combined donation count, and exact known-currency totals grouped by currency; mixed-currency records are identified instead of being combined into a misleading amount. The browser never calls the public website registry directly, and no supporter projection is persisted by the installation.

## Card UI

### Shared card system

Feature pages import the public API from `frontend/src/components/card-system`. Its high-level components are `CardDisplay`, `CardRow`, `CardIdentity`, `CardDialog`, `CardLegend`, and `CardStack`.

The system centralizes card structure, borders, image handling, badges, ownership and unavailable states, responsive behavior, and keyboard/touch interactions. Pages supply data, layout, and actions rather than assembling their own card visuals.

Approved `CardDisplay` variants include `grid`, `carousel`, `ranking`, `selectable`, `artwork`, and `compact-artwork`. A development-only component gallery is available at `/__card-system`.

See [`CARD_SYSTEM.md`](CARD_SYSTEM.md) for usage, design tokens, review guidance, and the contributor-friendly process for proposing a new shared variant.

`CardItem.jsx`, `UnifiedCard.jsx`, and the low-level state components remain implementation details of this public system and should not be imported by feature pages.

### `pages/CardSearch.jsx`

- Main search UI for locally cached TCGdex cards and matched custom cards
- Supports select mode for search results
- Can select the current page or all matching search results
- Bulk-add sends selected cards to `/api/collection/bulk-add` with default quantity `1`, condition `Mint`, no variant, no purchase price, and the card language
- Bulk-add success toast reports added, updated, and failed counts

### Scanner and review inbox

`components/UnifiedCardScanner.jsx` is the capture-only entry point. It supports a live viewfinder, the native device camera and gallery uploads, stages one or more photos, allows per-photo individual recognition overrides, and includes an optional positioning guide beside **Take photo**. Every submission enqueues a persistent job and routes to the same review inbox, including a one-photo scan.

`components/LiveCardViewfinder.jsx` is the fast path for a pile of cards: **Start camera** opens a `getUserMedia` preview and each **Capture card** tap stages one JPEG drawn at the stream's own resolution, with no operating-system camera round trip between cards. It is an addition, not a replacement - **Take photo** and **Choose from gallery** stay wired for every browser, permission state and device the viewfinder cannot serve, and the panel names the reason and points at them when it cannot start. A refusal is reported once and never re-prompted.

`utils/cameraCapture.js` holds the media plumbing behind that component: support detection (an insecure origin is reported as such rather than as an unsupported browser), error classification, frame capture, and a session object that owns at most one stream. Every abandonment path - stop, replacement, hidden tab, unmount, and a stream that resolves after the owner has gone - stops the tracks, because a leaked track leaves the camera indicator on.

`pages/ScanQueue.jsx` and `components/ScanReview.jsx` show job progress, retry countdowns/reasons, sanitized source photos, ranked candidates, failed items, individual retry, dismissal, and collection-add review. The quick-add control carries the badge counting outstanding items. A confirmed candidate id is sent when resolving an item so opted-in diagnostics can be labelled with human-reviewed ground truth.

`components/ScanAddModal.jsx` is the single add-to-collection step for a confirmed match. It defaults to quantity `1`, condition `Mint`, and the card's advertised default variant, takes the language from the recognised card and falls back to the review item's detected language, and stays disabled until the exchange rate is ready so a purchase price is never stored at the wrong rate.

Rate-limit countdowns distinguish daily quota from ordinary throttling. Photos remain available only while their item needs review and are deleted on confirmation/dismissal; jobs expire after 14 days.

The AI/Card Scanner section in `pages/Settings.jsx` shows **Share scanner diagnostics** as an available control only when the server configured writable `SCAN_TRACE_DIR` storage. The toggle is off by default. Turning it off stops future tracing without deleting existing data; the adjacent confirmed delete button removes all stored diagnostics for the current user and remains available through the stable cleanup path when new collection is disabled.

## API Layer

`frontend/src/api/client.js` is the central Axios client.

Notable frontend API bindings include:

- auth mode and force-password endpoints
- GitHub community endpoints
- social endpoints for leaderboard / compare / achievements
- selective backup download via `downloadBackup(include)`

## Removed / No Longer Documented

- No eBay integration in the current frontend
- No grading UI in the current frontend
